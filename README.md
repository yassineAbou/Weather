Users can view and add weather information for multiple cities of their choice with this app.  
It provides a 48-hour forecast, an 8-day forecast, and current weather conditions.  
The program can also detect the userâ€™s location to provide accurate local weather information.

I am trying to add a weather app to the Google Play Store. I have been rejected several times because my app requires background location permissions. I have been trying to fix this for a week, but I am not sure how. If you are able to help, please email me at  Abouyassine056@gmail.com

## Features
<p>To use the app's auto location feature, permission is needed. Here's how based on Android versions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android 7-10: The app asks for location directly.</li>
  <li>Android 11+: A dialog appears. Click "Ok" to go to settings and grant location access.</li>
</ul>


## API Key :key:
The project has an API key included. To use a different API key, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).
2. If you don't already have an account, register for one.
3. **Make sure you use One Call API 2.5. It is free to use for up to 1,000 API calls per day.**
4. Once you have an account, request an API key.
5. Open `WeatherApiService.kt`.
6. In the `WEATHER_API_KEY` property, paste your API key.



## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
* A single-activity architecture, using the [ViewPager2](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/animations/screen-slide-2) to display a collection of fragments in a scrollable, swipeable interface.
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)(MVVM) which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.
